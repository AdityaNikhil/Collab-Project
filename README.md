Hello there!
First of all,thank you for reviewing the repository.
Like Jawaharlal Nehru said,"great books makes one think since they are written by great minds!"
-----------------------------
So here's my plan,
1)Lets make a website to rent Books!
2)I want the website to be eye-catching and Responsive.
  I tried my best to make a template for the website.(Thumbs up if u liked it :') )
3)I want to gather a team of members who are good at 
  -->Backend
  -->Designing
  -->Markup 
  -->Programming
  -->Social advertising
  I hope that's it!
Thank you for your support in advance.Can't wait to get this going!
